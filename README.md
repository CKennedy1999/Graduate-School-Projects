## STAT 535 - Statistical Computing (Python)

## STAT 610 - Bayesian Statistics (R)

Bayesian Inference: Google Stock Data

Packages: tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble), tidyquant, lubridate, bsts

Fit and train a Bayesian structural time series model on 'GOOGL' daily closing price from 2011 to 2020 to predict prices for the first six months of 2021.

Models were selected after exploratory data analysis determined a log-differenced price would render data as stationary.

Techniques: Arima(1,1,0) a differenced first-order auto regressive model, Bayesian structural model with auto regressive local level term

## STAT 691P - Project Seminar (R)

## STAT 697D - Applied Statistics and Data Analysis (R)

Analysis of Income Segregation and Intergenerational Mobility Across Colleges in the United States

Packages: tidyverse, lme4, skimr, corrplot

Use mixed effect models to investigate long term outcomes of students from low-income families after attending selective universities. How does the median parent income vary with each tier of school? Quantify the effect of Ivy plus schools on a defined success rate. Parse the relationship between the income mobility rate and success rate.

## STAT 697DS - Statistical Methods for Data Science (R)

A Data Driven Approach to Fantasy Roster Building and MLB All-star Selections

Packages: tidyverse, Lahman, GGally, leaps, glmnet, pls, boot, gam, MASS, randomForest, gbm, caret 

**Quantitative Goal:**

Predict future fantasy baseball scoring for a player using prior information.

Fit and validate regression models to compare strengths and weaknesses of each.

Techniques: linear regression, subset selection, LASSO, partial least squares, polynomial regression, natural cubic spline, smoothing spline, local regression, generalized additive model (GAM)

**Qualitative Goal:**

Classify players into all-stars and non all-stars using only their statistical footprint.

Fit and validate classification models to compare strengths and weaknesses of each.

Techniques: logistic regression (GLM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), bagging, random forest (RF), boosting
