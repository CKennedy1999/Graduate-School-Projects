A Data Driven Approach to Fantasy Roster Building and MLB All-star Selections

Packages: tidyverse, Lahman, GGally, leaps, glmnet, pls, boot, gam, MASS, randomForest, gbm, caret 

**Quantitative Goal:**

Predict future fantasy baseball scoring for a player using prior information.

Fit and validate regression models to compare strengths and weaknesses of each.

Techniques: linear regression, subset selection, LASSO, partial least squares, polynomial regression, natural cubic spline, smoothing spline, local regression, generalized additive model (GAM)

**Qualitative Goal:**

Classify players into all-stars and non all-stars using only their statistical footprint.

Fit and validate classification models to compare strengths and weaknesses of each.

Techniques: logistic regression (GLM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), bagging, random forest (RF), boosting
